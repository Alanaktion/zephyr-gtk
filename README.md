# Zephyr GTK

A flat pale green Gtk theme based on Breeze Dark

## Building

This repo contains the compiled theme, but building it from the original Breeze theme is as simple as copying the compiled Breeze Dark files to this directory and running `convert.sh`. ImageMagick is required to convert the PNG assets, and GNU sed is required for text file replacements.

### Xfwm theme

Note that the Xfwm theme is custom-built and is not built from the Breeze GTK files.

## License

Like the Breeze GTK theme, this theme is licensed under version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
